# Overview

This is a simple iOS application to fetch and display the last 20 images from Flickr.

When image is selected, it's displayed on a separate screen without any cropping.

# Libraries

I've used the following iOS libraries:

* Reporter to achieve dependency inversion or multidelegating
* Alamofire and AlamofireImage to request images
* Anchorage to lay items out
* SwiftyJSON to parse JSON
* Cocoa Pods to get almost all of the above libraries in
* XcodeGen to generate Xcode project
